Learning Journal for Week 4
Learning Activities & Resources:
Following the tutorial course, I opted for XAMPP as my local development environment. XAMPP offers a comprehensive package that includes Apache, MySQL, PHP, and Perl. Its widespread use and robust community support gave me confidence in its reliability and the availability of resources for troubleshooting.

Estimated Hours:
Approximately 3 hours

Content Insights:
While exploring different local development environments, I also considered WAMP and Docker. WAMP is a popular choice, particularly for Windows users, but I found XAMPP to provide a more user-friendly experience. Docker, though highly powerful and versatile, has a steeper learning curve and is better suited for complex development projects, which exceeded my current needs. Ultimately, XAMPP's cross-platform compatibility and straightforward setup process made it the best choice for my project requirements.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
Setting up a local development environment has been a valuable learning experience. It has allowed me to experiment with WordPress features without the limitations of an online environment. In the future, I plan to learn how to deploy a local WordPress site to a live server, which is a crucial skill for my career in web development.
