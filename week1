Week 1
HTML and CSS are the foundational languages of web design. This time, I chose to write the code myself instead of relying on ready-made templates like Bootstrap. While understanding templates is one thing, effectively applying them can be challenging. By writing my code and troubleshooting issues along the way, I gained a deeper understanding of code structure and management. I opted for a single-page design with multiple sections, using "id" attributes for clickable navigation. However, I found that this method only allowed the target area to top-align, not center-align. I learned that achieving a centered effect requires a combination of CSS and JavaScript, which I omitted for now as my focus was more on design concepts.

In CSS, I utilized responsive design techniques with the "@media" rule to ensure the website adapts to different display devices. During this process, I discovered that on smaller screens, the top navigation bar was incomplete. To address this, I added a "menu" button as an alternative, though I didn't expand on this feature with CSS and JavaScript for the time being.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights
This practical exercise underscored the importance of understanding web design principles, particularly in making users quickly and intuitively grasp my startup business. With no prior experience in this area, I drew inspiration from exemplary websites, such as Apple's, to learn from their layout and design. Although I didn't delve deeply into the functionality of the code—a task typically handled by front-end developers—as an aspiring back-end engineer, I recognized the significance of design thinking.

In today's landscape, numerous low-code tools allow individuals with minimal coding skills to create functional websites. This exercise also highlighted the importance of combining theoretical knowledge with practical application. I realized that watching educational resources can only take you so far; hands-on experience is crucial for truly understanding and mastering web design.

Reflection on My Journey
Embarking on this journey to create a basic flower shop website has been a significant learning experience. By stepping out of my comfort zone and writing the code myself, I gained valuable insights into the intricacies of web design. This project has not only enhanced my technical skills but also broadened my perspective on the importance of user-friendly design and responsiveness. Moving forward, I plan to continue exploring and integrating more advanced features, including JavaScript enhancements, to further refine my web development abilities.
